It can be installed directly from GitHub via:
```
pip install --user git+https://github.com/openkim/kim-python-utils
```

This package's functionality has been integrated into kim-tools: https://github.com/openkim/kim-tools

New Tests and VCs will use kim-tools, and this package will eventually be deprecated.
